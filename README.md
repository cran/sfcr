The goal of the `sfcr` package is to provide an intuitive and `tidy` way
to estimate stock-flow consistent (SFC) models with R.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joaomacalos/sfcr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how to simulate the “SIM” model from
Godley and Lavoie (2007 ch. 3), as well as how to add scenarios to this
baseline model.

The `sfcr_set()` function is used to create define the equations and
external variables of the model.

These sets are used to simulate the baseline scenario of the model with
the `sfcr_baseline()` function:

``` r
library(sfcr)

eqs <- sfcr_set(
  TXs ~ TXd,
  YD ~ W * Ns - TXs,
  Cd ~ alpha1 * YD + alpha2 * Hh[-1],
  Hh ~ YD - Cd + Hh[-1],
  Ns ~ Nd,
  Nd ~ Y / W,
  Cs ~ Cd,
  Gs ~ Gd,
  Y ~ Cs + Gs,
  TXd ~ theta * W * Ns,
  Hs ~ Gd - TXd + Hs[-1]
)

external <- sfcr_set(
  Gd ~ 20, 
  W ~ 1,
  alpha1 ~ 0.6,
  alpha2 ~ 0.4,
  theta ~ 0.2
  )

sim <- sfcr_baseline(
  equations = eqs, 
  external = external,
  periods = 60, 
  
  )

sim

```

With the steady state values at hand, we can use the `sfcr_scenario()`
function to see what happens if we increase government expenditures `Gd`
from 20 to 30:

``` r
shock <- sfcr_shock(
  variables = sfcr_set(
    Gd ~ 30
  ),
  start = 5,
  end = 60
)

sim2 <- sfcr_scenario(
  baseline = sim,
  scenario = shock,
  periods = 60
  )

sim2

With `sfcr`, the models are written entirely within R and use the
standard R syntax. Furthermore, their output is a `tibble`, meaning that
it can be easily manipulated with `dplyr` and other `tidyverse` tools
and plotted with `ggplot2`.

### Acknowledgments

I’m grateful to Severin Reissl for his very useful comments and for
always pointing me in the right direction, to Marc Lavoie for answering
all my questions about SFC modeling, and to Italo Pedrosa for our
discussions about the state of the SFC field.

I’d also like to acknowledge all the developers and academics that share
their code and make the SFC field alive. In particular, many thanks to
Antoine Godin for answering all my queries about the `PKSFC`
[package](https://github.com/S120/PKSFC), from which I draw much
inspiration, specially in the DAGs section of the package, to Gabriel
Petrini da Silveira and Kenn Takara for their `pysolve3`
[package](https://github.com/gpetrini/pysolve3), from which I found the
references to implement the Broyden solver in R, and to Gennaro Zezza
for his invaluable
[macros](http://gennaro.zezza.it/software/eviews/gl2006.php) to simulate
the models in Godley and Lavoie (2007).
